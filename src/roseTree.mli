(** {1 Rose Tree}

   A persistent, non-lazy tree where each node may have an arbitrary number of
   children.

   @since 0.8 *)

(** The type of a tree node - a (value, children) pair.  *)
type +'a t = [`Node of 'a * 'a t list]

type 'a tree = 'a t

type 'a sequence = ('a -> unit) -> unit
type 'a printer = Format.formatter -> 'a -> unit

(**
   Folds over the tree. Takes a function [f node accumulator], an initial value
   for the accumulator, and the tree to operate on.
*)
val fold : f : ('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'b ->  'a t -> 'b

(** Iterate over the tree *)
val to_seq : 'a t -> 'a sequence

(**
   Tree pretty-printer. Takes a [Formatter], a function turning a node into a
   string, and the tree itself as parameters. Appends the result to the
   formatter.
*)
val print : 'a printer -> 'a t printer

(**
   {2 Zipper}

   A zipper to navigate and return modified versions of the tree.
*)
module Zipper : sig

  type 'a t

  (**
     Builds a zipper from a tree.
  *)
  val zipper : 'a tree -> 'a t

  (**
     Returns the tree associated to the zipper.
  *)
  val tree : 'a t -> 'a tree

  (**
     Moves to the left of the currently focused node, if possible. Returns [Some
     new_zipper], or [None] if the focused node had no left sibling.
  *)
  val left_sibling : 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (**
     Moves to the right of the currently focused node, if possible. Returns [Some
     new_zipper], or [None] if the focused node had no right sibling.
  *)
  val right_sibling : 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (**
     Moves one level up of the currently focused node, if possible. Returns
     [Some new_zipper], or [None] if the focused node was the root.
  *)
  val parent : 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (**
     Moves to the root of the tree.
  *)
  val root : 'a t -> 'a t

  (** Iterate over the ancestors up to the root, beginning with the current
   * node *)
  val parent_seq: 'a t -> ('a t -> 'b) -> unit

  (** Fold over the sequence of ancestors up to the root *)
  val parent_fold : ('b -> 'a t -> 'b) -> 'b -> 'a t -> 'b

  (**
     Moves to the nth child of the current node. Accepts the child number,
     starting from zero. Returns [Some new_zipper], or [None] if there was no
     such child.
  *)
  val nth_child : int -> 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (** Iterate over the immediate children *)
  val children_seq: 'a t -> ('a t -> 'b) -> unit

  (**
     Inserts a new node as the leftmost child of the currently focused node.
     Returns a new zipper, focused on the newly inserted node.
  *)
  val append_child : 'a tree -> 'a t -> 'a t

  (**
     Inserts a new node to the left of the currently focused node.
     Returns [Some new_zipper], focused on the newly inserted node, if the
     focused node is not the root. If the currently focused node is the root,
     returns [None].
  *)
  val insert_left_sibling : 'a tree -> 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (**
     Inserts a new node to the right of the currently focused node.
     Returns [Some new_zipper], focused on the newly inserted node, if the
     focused node is not the root. If the currently focused node is the root,
     returns [None].
  *)
  val insert_right_sibling : 'a tree -> 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (**
     Replaces the currently focused node with a new node.
     Returns a new zipper, focused on the new node.
  *)
  val replace : 'a tree -> 'a t -> 'a t

  (**
     Deletes the currently focused node.
     If the currently focused node is the root, returns [None].
     Otherwise, returns a [Some new_zipper]. It is focused on the left sibling
     of the deleted node. If there is no left sibling available, the zipper is
     focused on the right sibling. If there are no siblings, the zipper is
     focused on the parent of the focused node.
  *)
  val delete : 'a t -> ('a t) option

  (** Are we at a leaf node? *)
  val at_leaf : 'a t -> bool

  (**
     Give the address of the current zipper position, as an integer list of
     child_indices descending from the root from left to right
  *)
  val address : 'a t -> int list

  (**
     Move down from the current node by the relative address given as an int
     list of child indices.
  *)
  val zip_down : int list -> 'a t -> 'a t option

  (**
     Move to the node at an address relative to the root, given as an int
     list of child indices.
  *)
  val zip_to : int list -> 'a t -> 'a t option
